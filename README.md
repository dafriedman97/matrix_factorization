This repository provides code for running matrix factorization, a state of the art collaborative filtering technique for recommender systems, using just numpy and plain python. The code is quite simple and self-contained `matrix_factorization.py`. `derivations.pdf` shows the mathematical derivations behind matrix factorization. This write-up largely follows Charu Aggarwal's *Recommender Systems: The Textbook*.
